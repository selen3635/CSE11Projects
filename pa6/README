Program Description:

   This program is designed to draw pizzas on canvas. Canvas is separated
 into four quadrant. User can simply click anywhere on canvas to draw pizza
 . Each canvas will show different color of pizza, and all pizza is point to
 the intersections of two lines. Futhermore, user can also press and drag
 lines arround canvas. The color of pizzas will change while user drag the
 line, because the color of pizzas if based on which quadrant they are in.
 Moving the lines and creating more pizza, new pizza will still point to
 intersection of lines, but old pizzas will keep old orientation. In
 addition, user can also resize the frame, but lines will stay same
 proportional to where they were on the canvas. In the meantime, pizza will
 stay in the same position where they were created. Moreover, there are
 buttons ne the canvas, named start, stop, clear all respectively. When
 program start, if user click and create new pizza it will spin clockwise.
 User can click stop button to stop pizza spin, and click start to restart
 spining pizza. The clear all button will clear all pizza on canvas if user
 click on it. There is a slider on the bottom of canvas and a label text 
 shows current spining speed. After user create pizza, user can increase
 or decrease spining speed by slide the slider on the bottom. The minimum
 speed is 1 and maximum speed is 100. When user create new pizzas, new
 pizza will spin if old pizzas are spining otherwise pizza will stay static
 as old pizza. Pizzas are able to be drag arround canvas, but the tip of 
 pizza can't be drag off canvas with 5 pixels margin from canvas. User can
 also drag mutiple pizza even with lines in a time, if pizzas and lines are
 overlap, and user click on all of them. In this case, user can drag
 multiple pizzas in a time.

EC part(both):

   For this program, it has all the same functions as previous program.
However, this program has some more functionalities. Such as, there is one
more button on the canvas which called "Switch Spin". User can controll the
spin direction of pizza through this button. For example, if pizzas are
spinning clock wise right now, it will spin counter clock wise if user 
click this button which means after clicking this button it always change
the the spin direction to opposite direction. Further more, there is one 
more funny function. When user resize canvas, all pizza will move
proportionally with canvas size.

   and the interface body.
   (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/interfaceDef.html)
