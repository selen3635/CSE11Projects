ResizablePizzaSliceController:

   This program is designed to draw pizzas on canvas. Canvas is separated
into four quadrant. User can simply click anywhere on canvas to draw pizza
. Each canvas will show different color of pizza, and all pizza is point to
the intersections of two lines. Futhermore, user can also press and drag
lines arround canvas. The color of pizzas will change while user drag the
line, because the color of pizzas if based on which quadrant they are in.
Moving the lines and creating more pizza, new pizza will still point to
intersection of lines, but old pizzas will keep old orientation. In
addition, user can also resize the frame, but lines will stay same
proportional to where they were on the canvas. In the meantime, pizza will
stay in the same position where they were created. The funny thing is pizzas
are not static, they are growing and shrinking all the time on the canvas.
