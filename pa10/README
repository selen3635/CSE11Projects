1. The most helpful material for me with my PAs will be write up. It has
a lot of information that i need for PAs. Beside this, i usually specific
java library if i need some functionalities from library. Also, TA will
be another sources that help me with my PAs.


2.  Shallow copy points to the same location in memory. Deep copy points
 to a different location in memory, but the contents are the same. So we 
 can check by this way.

 if ( line2 == line1 ) {

   System.out.println("This is a shallow copy");
 }

 if ( line1.equals(line2)) {

   System.out.println("This is a deep copy");
 }


3.   Point point1 = new Point(0, 0);
     Point point2 = new Point(100, 100);
     Point point3 = new Point(50, 50);
     CSE11_Line line1 = new CSE11_Line(point1, point2);
     CSE11_Line line2 = new CSE11_Line(point1, point2);
     CSE11_Line line3 = new CSE11_Line(point1, point3);

In order to check equal() method to determine if it is doint a deep
comparison vs a shallow reference comparason.

  if ( !(line1 == line2) && line1.equals(line2) ) {

    System.out.println(" the euqal method is doing deep comparison");

  }

  now we have another line which is line3 with different point.
  
  if( line1.equals(line3)) {

    System.out.println("the equal method is doing shallow comparison);

  }

  else {

    System.out.println("the equal method is doing deep comparison");
  }
