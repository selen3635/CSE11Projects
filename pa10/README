a lot of information that i need for PAs. Beside this, i usually specific
java library if i need some functionalities from library. Also, TA will
be another sources that help me with my PAs.


2.  Shallow copy points to the same location in memory. Deep copy points
 to a different location in memory, but the contents are the same. So we 
 can check by this way.
