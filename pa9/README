Program Description:


Program 1: CS11TurtleGraphics_Threaded.java

  This program will create a world, and use this world to display turtle,
and draw charactors on it. It will create multiple turtles and same time,
and then starting to draw charactors at same time, but maybe end with
different time. These turtles going to draw charactors are "CS11 FAUG
JAVA UC SAN DIEGO". By default, each turtle has different color, so it will
looks colorful when they done with drawwing. When these turtle draw 
charactors, they have half second delay. Which means, it won't be really
fast so we can see how do they draw the charactors.


Program 2: Rational.java

  This program is going test all methods such as add, subtract, multiply,
and division. There are 40 tests, which include all possibilities. It 
doesn't require user to enter anything. Test case has all possibilities to
test whether program is correct. For example, if denominator equals to 0,
it will throw out an exception. If denominator equals to 1, then it will
just equals to numerator. The reduce method is going to reduce rational
to its simplified version by dividing great common divisor. For instance,
if a rational is 4/2, after reduce method, it will be 2. Add, subtract,
multiply, and division, these are math method. Lets say we have two
rational 1/2, and 1/3. If you add them together, it will be 5/6. If you
subtract them, you will get 1/6. If you multiply them, you will get 1/6.
If you divide them, you will get 3/2. This is how we test our program.
I think this program has been well tested since we consider all possible
cases.




1. cat -n readFile

2. cat -T readFile
 
   cat -e readFile

   end of line: $      tab:  ^I
   
   we can tell there is trailing whitespace on the line, when there is 
 a space between ^I and $ symbol.

3.  nl readFile

    5 spaces at begining of line
    a tab divide the line number from fist character of the line


4.  in command mode,  type  :set nu

5.  in command mode, type   :set list
    
    indicate end of line:  $    tab: ^I

    We can tell there is trailing whitespace on the line, when there is
    a space between ^I and $ symbol


6.  in command mode, type   :%s/fun/amazing/g

    in command mode, type :%s/fun/amazing  to find and replace the 
    first instance of the word fun.
